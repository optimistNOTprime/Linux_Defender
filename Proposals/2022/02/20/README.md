# Raspberry Pi support increase

The Raspberry Pi is a unique Linux device, and its main operating system (Raspberry Pi OS/RaspbianOS) is lacking a good anti-virus. Since I have a couple functional Raspberry Pi devices, I feel it would be good to test for this platform constantly, alongside Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Fedora, and Manjaro.

This will be a specific port. It will be different from the main Debian build, and will be specific to Raspberry Pi OS 4 and later versions. A port for RaspbianOS will be unlikely, due to how old it is.
