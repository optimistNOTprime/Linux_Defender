Linux defender
Ransom update 1

The generous evil: de-activates Ransomware when the servers are down (recommended for Virtual Machine tests of Ransomware)

Fake ransom check: sends broken cryptocurrency packets to the ransomware servers so that they get nothing, and you have the chance of getting your files back (experimental)

Ransback: Reminds you to back up your files when needed to protect against ransomware

MBR Defender: Defends the Master Boot Record from damage (this honestly should be included with the system)
