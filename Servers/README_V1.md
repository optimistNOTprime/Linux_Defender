# Information update

**Issued:** January 9th 2021

<p><u>I made an error</u></p> <!-- This HTML code snippet currently isn't working for me in the preview. If anyone knows how to underline in markdown, you can correct this to fix it !-->

In the past 2 weeks (on December 29th 2020/December 30th 2020, 11-12 days ago) I have looked up ClamAV again, and have found that I had far too limited information when originally reporting ClamAV for only Mail servers.

I have been contemplating on when I should issue this update. I finally got to it today. I can't misinform my followers. I need to make sure you know that I was wrong on the functionality of ClamAV, due to insufficient research.

I will keep the install link here, as I don't want to stifle competition. Just note that ClamAV is **NOT** just for mail servers. Free software projects should support each other. You should go support ClamAV now (if you want) [Click/tap here to view Clam AntiVirus on GitHub](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav-devel)

I will work on differentiating Linux Defender from ClamAV better. I needed to issue this notice before continuing work on this project, as I needed to correct this information and make it clear.

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read / in a nutshell)

ClamShell AV isn't just for mail servers. I originally said it was only for mail servers, and now after further research, I am correcting this statement. [Help me improve this "in a nutshell" description by raising an issue here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux_Defender/issues/new)
