# Google-based Linux support

This document goes over support of Google-based Linux systems.

## Android

There is a common argument that Android isn't a Linux distribution and or isn't considered "true Linux". For the sake of this project, I consider Android to be Linux based due to 1 major factor:

* Every version of Android (from the early beta to the present (As of Android 11)) has made use of the Linux kernel

Please note that Android is not a good Linux distribution in the open source philosophy as Android is heavily proprietary, and lacks open source efforts. Looking back on this on 2021 September 9th, I am considering changing this decision, as most kernel functions aren't accessible without heavy modification.

## ChromeOS and ChromiumOS

ChromeOS and ChromiumOS are currently based on Gentoo Linux (as of 2021 Thursday September 9th) originally, it was Debian based. I respect Android more than I do ChromeOS, and I have decided not to support ChromeOS for many reasons, including:

* ChromeOS is anti-competitive and promotes a bad style of usability

* ChromeBooks, ChromeBlyats, ChromeBits, and ChromeBases encourage planned obsolescence, which is a major contributor to climate change and the end of humanity.

* ChromeOS devices are absolute garbage and you should just spend the extra $50 getting a computer that can do more than be a web browser

* ChromeOS isn't really an operating system, it is just the Chrome web browser

* You can't even get other browser support on ChromeOS`

* ChromeOS devices fail all software and hardware longevity standards [See more](https://github.com/Computing-longevity/) 

## Goobuntu

Goobuntu is out of date and is no longer supported. It was based on Ubuntu. It is not supported here, as it never really made much use out of the Google corporation, and it is not worth supporting.

## Google Fushsia

# NOT LINUX BASED

Google Fuchsia is not supported, as it is not Linux based, it is based on the lesser known Zircon kernel.
