# Logo for Linux defender

At the moment (as of December 23rd 2020) the Linux defender program doesn't have a logo. I have not gotten used to graphic design/image manipulation on Linux, and I have an idea that I currently can't do:

My idea is for the logo to be of a smug tux (angry eyebrews, but proud smirk) holding a golden sword on the left, and holding a shield on the right. I want there to be multiple logos, so here are some variations:

Left:

1. Golden sword

2. Iron sword

3. WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator) bottle

4. Diamond sword

5. Ray gun

6. Other

Right:

1. Windows Defender shield

2. Linux logo shield

3. Apple shield

4. Glass shield

5. Silver shield

6. Gold shield

7. HTML5 shield

8. CSS3 shield

9. Error shield

10. Other

Hat:

1. Viking helmet

2. Knight helmet

3. Cowboy hat

4. Police officer hat

5. Fireman helmet

6. Medical helmet (with red cross)

7. Other

Foreground:

1. Nothing

2. Firewall

3. Other

Background:

1. Nothing

2. Firewall

3. Other

Body:

1. Tux

2. Pink Tux

3. Other

I am thinking maybe the logo could be interactive and switch between these items
